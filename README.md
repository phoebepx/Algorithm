# Algorithm
Algorithms playground for common questions solved in **Python**.

This repository contains my solution for some common algorithms. I've created this repository to learn about algorithms and improve solving different common computer science problems. I'll try to add more solutions if I have time :)

Each solved problem has a program written in Python. Every solution is tested and some problems contains more than one solution with different implementations.

## Problems
### Linked list 链表
* [Add Two Numbers--单链表实现两数相加](https://github.com/phoebepx/Algorithm/blob/master/Linked%20list/Add%20Two%20Numbers.py)

### LeetCode
* [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters---最长不重复子串长度](https://github.com/phoebepx/Algorithm/blob/master/LeetCode/Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters.py)
* [Median of Two Sorted Arrays---两有序数组求中位数O（log(m+n)）](https://github.com/phoebepx/Algorithm/blob/master/LeetCode/Median%20of%20Two%20Sorted%20Arrays.py)
* [Longest Palindromic Substring---字符串最长回文子串](https://github.com/phoebepx/Algorithm/blob/master/LeetCode/Longest%20Palindromic%20Substring.py)
